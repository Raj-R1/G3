| Flight Mate: Your flight booking assistant | AI in Aviation |


## Introduction

Briefly introduce the industry and the specific application of AI. Explain why it's important and the potential impact it could have.

The industry of aviation and its related branches have advanced to great heights since the introduction of micro-technology into it, but as the industry
slowly marches onwards, so does the skill required for using it. AI is already being trained on data from millions of flights every year, preparing for an
eventual takeover of the industry with it, but is hardly used anywhere on the customer side, such as in booking websites or online check ins. The introduction of  
a simple chatbot to handle all the advanced tasks can revolutionize the booking experience, making it easy and convenient for everyone, and significantly benefit older folks who usually struggle with newer technology. It could make booking flights as easy as setting a alarm using a voice assistant, and make it much more safer and reliable than manually scrolling through a list of flights for hours.

## The Role of AI in the Industry

Discuss the role of AI in this industry. How is it currently being utilized? What potential does it have?

AI has already found its way into the aviation industry, completely transforming multiple sub branches of it. For example, AI models are currently in use for predicting environment sensor malfunctions, by being trained on previous sensor data pre-malfunction and drawing patterns from it. Such accurate predictions can save hundreds of lives when used correctly, and disasters like the Lion Air Flight 610 incident can be avoided in the future (failure of PITO tubes, triggering MCAS, resulting in a crash that took all 189 lives onboard). Furthermore, AI is also being deployed to maximize efficiency of flight operations, routing the best paths after weighing factors like fuel cost, time, distance, efficiency, weather etc. and perhaps most importantly, in ATC management, decreasing the pressure on human operators and improving work environment while increasing the safety of the infrastructure, so that human error related mishaps like the on-runway collision of KLM Air flight 4805 and Pan Am Air flight 1736, which resulted in a tragic loss of nearly 600 souls can be avoided in the future.

While chatbots havent found much use in the industry yet, they aim to revolutionize the customer experience, i.e the process of booking tickets, and confirming details for the flight by making them much more convinient and easier to access for everyone, esepcially people that struggle with modern technology.

# AI Application Case Study:

## The Problem

Clearly state the problem that your business idea will address. Why is it important? How does it tie into the broader industry and AI application?

The problem is that current-generation technology is too complicated and convoluted for some people, and booking a flight ticket is time-taking and involves decisions that can significantly affect finances. A chatbot to simplify all these things into a simple prompt-based conversation would make it infinitely more accessible and convenient for all users. The chatbot would fit well into almost every company's infrastructure as almost all of them have been working on introducing aspects of AI into their services. 

## The Solution

### Describe your proposed AI-based solution

What will it do? How will it work? Why is it a good fit for this problem?

The chatbot will provide prompts and take responses in the form of text, and look for ideal flight routes, keeping in mind all the various factors that affect client experience, such as flight time, cost, class, etc. It will work based on NLP, trained on sample conversations, while also being interactive and real-time. It aims simplify the process of booking a ticket to the point where even a child with the right information and permission could do it.
### Target Market

Identify the potential customers for your solution. Why would they be interested in your product? What benefit would it bring them?
The potential customers are older people, who generally struggle with technology, and people with disabilities, who cannot reliably depend on their accessibility devices to handle complicated tasks. They would be interested because the chatbot covers everything related to booking a flight, and provides a seamless experience when paired with speech recognition. It would allow them to be slightly more independent, and more educated about their decisions regarding their flights.

## Analysis of the Solution

Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution. What does it do well? Where could it improve? What are the potential consequences or implications of this technology?
Discuss the potential challenges in implementing your business idea. This could include technical issues, regulatory concerns, ethical considerations, etc. Also, consider the limitations of your AI solution.


The solution is extremely effective for simpler bookings, and excels at taking simple inputs and summarizing the booking. However, it struggles to consider all the factors involved, such as connections, delays, and transportation issues. We can only provide services to limited areas within Europe and Asia.

## (Optional)Future Scope

Discuss how your business idea could evolve in the future and what potential impact it could have on the industry.

Our chatbot can only offer services to certain places; in the future, we hope to expand our horizons into lesser-known areas.The booking process might be revolutionized forever by a straightforward chatbot to handle all the complex chores, making it simple and convenient for everyone while also greatly assisting elderly people. It may make booking tickets as simple as using a voice assistant to set an alarm and far safer and more dependable than spending hours manually browsing through a list of itineraries.

# Conclusion

Summarize the main points of the blog post. Reiterate the importance of the AI application in the industry and the potential of your business idea.

All in all, over the years the aviation industry has made several progress however with that came several failures as well. With the additiion of our chatbot we can minimize these failures. AI algorithms can help users make informed decisions about how and when to book their flights to get the best prices, potentially saving them their time and money.
